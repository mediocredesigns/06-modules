		<h1>Modules</h1>
		<p>
			Javascript modules are reusable pieces of code that can be exported from
			one program and imported for use in another program. Modules are a way to
			split up large programs into smaller pieces. Each module is a piece of
			code that is executed once it is loaded. Modules use the export keyword to
			export code to another program, and the import keyword to import code from
			another program.

			import {
				inventory as stringInventory,
				add as addString,
			} from "./stringInventory.js";
			addString("Hello");
			addNumber(2);
			console.log({ numberInventory, stringInventory });
