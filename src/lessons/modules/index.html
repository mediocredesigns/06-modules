    <h1>Modules</h1>
    <p>
      Javascript modules are reusable pieces of code that can be exported from
      one program and imported for use in another program. Modules are a way to
      split up large programs into smaller pieces. Each module is a piece of
      code that is executed once it is loaded. Modules use the export keyword to
      export code to another program, and the import keyword to import code from
      another program.
